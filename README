MAKE-PASSWORD
-------------

Returns a password with at least BITS random bits and
at least one character from each character CLASSES.

BITS ensures that guessing the password has a probability lower than
(/ 1 (expt 2 BITS))

Examples :

;;  by default we get 64 random bits using all character classes

(make-password)
~> "5cez/]iPQc"

(make-password)
~> "IFg8(O,aBl"

;;  still 64 random bits but using only lower case, makes password longer

(make-password :classes :lower)
~> "rdscqmusxxisfa"

(make-password :classes :alphanum)
~> "opQV92RJmgg"

;;  more bits

(make-password :bits 128)
~> "L]A8.-Jsc_v{UdQP-mjQ"
